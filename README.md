HEXITEC-GSE
===========

The HEXITEC ground data processing system

Please see "lookatme.jpg" to get a sense of the intended use-case for this repository.

Currently, the hexitec_exposure object is the main object in this repository. The purpose of this object is to be able to import data from various sources (files, IO devices, etc.) and parse the data into n-dimensional arrays, where it can then be exported back to a file or other destination as raw data or as spectral or hyperspectral data.
